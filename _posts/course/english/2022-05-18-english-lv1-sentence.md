## 词性

### 名词 n

詞類問題攻略：
- 看到 *冠詞(a/an/the) + ___ + 介係詞* 的形式時，選擇名詞
- 在*及物動詞後面*，選擇名詞
- 熟悉 *名詞+名詞* 的模式，第一個名詞當作adj，修飾第二個名詞
- 選項中剩兩個名詞時，選擇 *語意較通順* 的

### 动词 v

略

### 形容词 adj

英文单词容易误解是其他词性，却是adj的单词
- adj+er
- adj+est
- most
- any

詞類問題攻略：
- 看到 *冠詞(a/an/the) + ___ + 名詞* 的形式時，填入形容詞的可能性很高
- 看到 *be動詞+___* 的形式時，填入形容詞的可能性很高
- 熟悉 *動名詞+名詞* 的名詞詞組模式
- 在 *介係詞to的後面* ，選擇動名詞
- 在 *become的后面*，选择adj
- 在 *名词*或是*名词短语*的前面，选择adj

形容詞與[副詞](#adverb)都是修飾語，形容詞是用來修飾「[名詞](#noun)」或「[代名詞](#pronoun)」；而副詞則是用來修飾「[動詞](#verb)」、「形容詞」或其他「[副詞](#adverb)」。
這些修飾語可有可無, 拿掉修飾語並不影響句子結構的正確性；然而少了修飾語，卻會削弱語文表達的能力。

### 副词 adv

英文单词容易误解是其他词性，却是adv的单词
- adj+ly
- very
- when

詞類問題攻略：
- **句型的構成要素具備時**，選擇副詞
- 在**助動詞和動詞**之間，選擇副詞
- 在**be動詞和過去分詞**之間，選擇副詞
- 在**修飾形容詞**的位置，選擇副詞

形容詞與[副詞](#adverb)都是修飾語，形容詞是用來修飾「[名詞](#noun)」或「[代名詞](#pronoun)」；而副詞則是用來修飾「[動詞](#verb)」、「形容詞」或其他「[副詞](#adverb)」。
這些修飾語可有可無, 拿掉修飾語並不影響句子結構的正確性；然而少了修飾語，卻會削弱語文表達的能力。

### 代名词 pron
