## Reference

### what is reference type

Reference types hold reference to objects and provide a means to access those objects stored
somewhere in memory. All reference types are a subclass of type `java.lang.Object`.

### where storage lives

> - Registers<br>
>   This is the fastest storage because it exists in a place different from that of other storage: inside the
>   central processing unit (CPU). However, the number of registers is severely limited, so registers are
>   allocated as they are needed. You don't have direct control over register allocation, nor do you see
>   any evidence in your programs that registers even exist (C & C++, on the other hand, allow you to
>   suggest register allocation to the compiler)
>
> - The stack (primitive types)<br>
>   This lives in the general random-access memory (RAM) area, but has direct support from the
>   processor via its stack pointer. The stack pointer is moved down to create new memory and moved
>   up to release that memory. This is an extremely fast and efficient way to allocate storage, second
>   only to registers. **The Java system must know, while it is creating the program, the exact lifetime of
>   all the items stored on the stack.** This constraint places limits on the flexibility of your programs, so
>   themselves are not placed on the stack.
>
> - The heap (reference type)<br>
>   This is a general-purpose pool of memory (also in the RAM area) where all Java objects live. **Unlike
>   the stack, the compiler doesn't need to know how long objects must stay on the heap. Thus, there's
>   a great deal of flexibility when using heap storage. Whenever you need an object, you write the
>   code to create it using new, and the storage is allocated on the heap when that code is executed.**
>   There's a price for this flexibility: It can take more time to allocate and clean up heap storage than
>   stack storage (if you even could create objects on the stack in Java, as you can in C++). Over time,
>   however, Java's heap allocation mechanism has become very fast, so this is not an issue for
>   concern.
>
> - Constant storage<br>
>   **Constant values are often placed directly in the program code, which is safe since they can never
>   change.** Sometimes constants are cordoned off by themselves so they can be optionally placed in
>   read-only memory (ROM), in embedded systems.
>
> - Non-RAM storage<br>
>   **If data lives completely outside a program, it can exist while the program is not running, outside the
>   control of the program.** The two primary examples of this area serialized object, where objects are
>   turned into streams of bytes, generally send to another machine, and persistent objects, where the
>   objects are placed on disk so they will hold their state even when the program is terminated. The
>   trick with there types of storage is turning the objects into something that exist on the other medium,
>   and yet be resurrected into a regular RAM-based object when necessary. Java provides support for
>   lightweight persistence. Libraries such as JDBC and Hibernate provide more sophisticated support
>   for storing and retrieving object information using databases.

### class

> “class” is (approximately) synonymous with “type.” -- on java 8 page 38

### constructor

- This guarantees that the object is properly initialized you can get your hands on it.
- Priority order:
   1. specific super constructor
   2. superclass' constructor without parameters
   3. constructor by programmer in superclass
   4. constructor by default in superclass

![](http://www.hauchenglee.com/assets/images/tech/invoke_constructor_order.png)

### static

Static is a non-access modifier in Java. Any static member can be accessed before any objects of its class
 are created, and without reference to any object. It is applicable for the following:
1. blocks
2. variables
3. methods
4. nested classes

Static block:
- It can be used for static initializations of a class.
- It will executed exactly **only once** when the class is **first loaded**.
- Static block

```
class Demo {
    static int i;
    static {
        System.out.println("static 1");
    }
    Demo() {
        System.out.println("static constructor");
    }
    static {
        System.out.println("static 2, i = " + i);
    }
}

public class TestDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo con = new Demo();
        System.out.println("main method");
        System.out.println("Demo.i = " + Demo.i);
    }
}

// static 1
// static 2, i = 0
// static constructor
// main method
// Demo.i = 0
```

Static variables:
- It is **class-level** variable instead of local variable.
- All instances of the class share the same static variable.

Static methods:
- They can only directly call other static methods.
- They can only directly access static data.
- They cannot refer to **this** or **super** in any way.

Static nested classes:
- Java allows us to define a class within another class which is called a nested class.
The class which enclosed nested class is known as Outer class.
- In java, we can't make Top level class static. **Only nested classes can be static.**

### final

Final data:
- final primitive: final makes the value a constant
- final reference: Once the reference is initialized to an object, it can **never be changed** to point
 to another object. However, the object itself can be modified.

Blank finals:
- Blank finals are final fields without initialization values. The compiler ensures that blank finals are
 initialized before use.
- You're forced to perform assignments to finals either with an expression at the point of definition of the
 field or in every **constructor**. This guarantees that the final fields is always initialized before use.

Final arguments:
- Inside the method you can **read and return** the argument, but you **can't change** it.
- `i + 1;` ok
- `i++;` not allow
- `final object = new Object();` not allow

Final methods
- The first reason is to put a "lock" on the method to **prevent an inheriting class from changing that
 method meaning by overriding it**. This is done for design reasons when you want to make sure that a
 method's behavior is retained during inheritance.
- The second reason is that final were suggested in the past is efficiency.

Final classes
- When you say that an entire class is final (by preceding its definition with the final keyword), you're
 **preventing all inheritance** from this class.
- The fields of a final class can be final or not, as you choose. The same rules apply to final for fields
regardless of whether the class is defined as final. However, because it prevents inheritance, all methods
in final class are **implicitly final**, since there's no way to override them. **You can include the final
specifier to a method in a final class, but it doesn't add any meaning.**

### overload

Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature
can differ by the **number of** input parameters or **type of** input parameters or both.

We can overload:
- common method
- static method
- main() method

We cannot overload:
- methods on return type
- methods that differ only by static keyword

> -- [Overloading in Java - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overloading-in-java/)

### override

Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a
 method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass
 has the **same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type)** as a method in its
 super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to *override* the method in the super-class.

![](http://www.hauchenglee.com/assets/images/tech/overriding-in-java.png)

The version of a method that is executed will be **determined by the object that is used to invoke it**. If
 an object of a *parent class* is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be
 executed, but if an object of the *subclass* is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class
 will be executed. In other words, **it is the type of the object being referred to ((not the type of the
 reference variable))** that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.

\* Tips: 決定 override version 的調用規則 → 形態看左邊（父），運行看右邊（子）

-  Rules for method overriding:
   - subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type)
   - without override, it cannot invoke the unique method in subclass with the type which referred to parent class
   - the access modifier for an overriding **can allow more, but not less**, access than the overridden method
   - we can call parent class method in overriding method using **super** keyword
   - abstract methods in an interface or abstract class are meant to be overridden in derived concrete classes
- Reason:
   - subclass has unique feature method
   - also run time **polymorphism**
- Cannot be override:
   - private modifier
   - final methods
   - static methods
- Exception handling: see [Java Exception]()

### upcasting

Upcasting is casting to a supertype, while downcasting is casting to subtype.
Upcasting is always allowed, but downcasting involves a type check and can throw a `ClassCastException`.

Example:
```
Animal animal = new Dog(); // this is upcasting
Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // this is downcasting
```

ClassCastException:
```
Animal animal = new Animal();
Cat cat = (Cat) animal; // ClassCastException
```

> -- [java - What is the difference between up-casting and down-casting with respect to class variable - Stack Overflow](https://bit.ly/33cj3g0)

### pass by value

Java is always **pass-by-value**.

> When an argument is passed by value, a copy of the argument’s value is passed to the
> called method. The called method works exclusively with the copy. Changes to the called
> method’s copy **do not affect** the original variable’s value in the caller.

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog("Max");
    Dog oldDog = aDog;

    // we pass the object to foo
    foo(aDog);

    // aDog variable is still pointing to the "Max" dog when foo(...) returns
    aDog.getName().equals("Max"); // true
    aDog.getName().equals("Fifi"); // false
    aDog = oldDog; // true    
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals("Max"); // true

    // change d inside of foo() to point to a new Dog instance "Fifi"
    d = new Dog("Fifi");
    d.getName().equals("Fifi"); // true
}
```

In the example above `aDog.getName()` will return `"Max"`. The value `aDog` within `main` is not
changed in the function `foo` with the `Dog Fifi` as the object reference is passed by value. If it
were passed by reference, then the `aDog.getName()` in `main` would return `Fifi` after the call to
`foo`.

Likewise:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog("Max");
    Dog oldDog = aDog;

    foo(aDog);

    // when foo(...) returns, the name of the dog has been changed to "Fifi"
    aDog.getName().equals("Fifi"); // true

    // but it is still the same dog:
    aDog = oldDog; // true
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals("Max"); // true

    // this changes the name of d to be "Fifi"
    d.setName("Fifi");
}
```

In the above example, `Fifi` is the dog's name after call to `foo(aDog)` because the object's name was
set inside of `foo(...)`. Any operations that `foo` performs on `d` are such that, for all practical
purposes, they are performed on `aDog`, but it is **not** possible to change the value of the variable
`aDog` itself.

### Abstract class

### Interface

## Characteristics

### encapsulation（封裝）

Data (or properties or attributes) and behaviour (the "methods" that operate on the data) are encapsulated into objects;
moreover, the data is *hidden* from the external world.

### inheritance（繼承）

An object's properties and behaviour can be inherited from a parent object.

### polymorphism（多態）

Objects of different kinds can adhere to the same interface or set of operations.

polymorphism:
- 事物在運行過程中存在不同的狀態。（使用一個父類，可以操作多個子類）
- 具有 is-a 關係

實施前提:
- 要有繼承關係
- 子類要重寫父類的方法
- 父類引用指向子类别
- 在繼承中父子類別有 static 的修飾，無法開啟多態

Example:
```
class Animal {
    int num = 10;
    static int age = 20;

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("animal eat");
    }

    public static void sleep() {
        System.out.println("animal sleep in static");
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("animal run");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    int num = 80;
    static int age = 90;
    String name = "tomcat";

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("cat eat");
    }

    public static void sleep() {
        System.out.println("cat sleep in static");
    }

    public void catchMouse() {
        System.out.println("cat catch mouse");
    }
}
```

TestUnit Demo:
```
class Demo_Test1 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Animal animal = new Cat();
        animal.eat();
        animal.sleep();
        animal.run();

        // animal.catchMouse();
        // log.info(animal.name)

        log.info(animal.num);
        log.info(animal.age);
    }
}
```

Console:
```
cat eat
animal sleep in static
animal run
10
20
```

以上的三段代码充分体现了多态的三个前提，即：
1. 存在继承关系：
Cat类继承了Animal类
2. 子类要重写父类的方法：
子类重写（override）了父类的两个成员方法eat()，sleep()。其中eat()是非静态的，sleep()是静态的（static）。
3. 父类数据类型的引用指向子类对象：
测试类Demo_Test1中`Animal animal = new Cat();`语句在堆内存中开辟了子类（Cat）的对象，并把栈内存中的父类（Animal）的引用指向了这个Cat对象

观察总结：
- 成员变量：编译看左边(父类)，运行看左边(父类)。
- 成员方法：编译看左边(父类)，运行看右边(子类)。动态绑定
- 静态方法：编译看左边(父类)，运行看左边(父类)。
(静态和类相关，算不上重写，所以，访问还是左边的)
只有非静态的成员方法，编译看左边，运行看右边

多态缺点：多态后不能使用子类特有的属性和方法

解决方法：强制转型`Cat cat = (Cat) animal;`
