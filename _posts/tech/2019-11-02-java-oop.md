## Reference

### what is reference type

Reference types hold reference to objects and provide a means to access those objects stored
somewhere in memory. All reference types are a subclass of type `java.lang.Object`.

### where storage lives

> - Registers<br>
>   This is the fastest storage because it exists in a place different from that of other storage: inside the
>   central processing unit (CPU). However, the number of registers is severely limited, so registers are
>   allocated as they are needed. You don't have direct control over register allocation, nor do you see
>   any evidence in your programs that registers even exist (C & C++, on the other hand, allow you to
>   suggest register allocation to the compiler)
>
> - The stack (primitive types)<br>
>   This lives in the general random-access memory (RAM) area, but has direct support from the
>   processor via its stack pointer. The stack pointer is moved down to create new memory and moved
>   up to release that memory. This is an extremely fast and efficient way to allocate storage, second
>   only to registers. **The Java system must know, while it is creating the program, the exact lifetime of
>   all the items stored on the stack.** This constraint places limits on the flexibility of your programs, so
>   themselves are not placed on the stack.
>
> - The heap (reference type)<br>
>   This is a general-purpose pool of memory (also in the RAM area) where all Java objects live. **Unlike
>   the stack, the compiler doesn't need to know how long objects must stay on the heap. Thus, there's
>   a great deal of flexibility when using heap storage. Whenever you need an object, you write the
>   code to create it using new, and the storage is allocated on the heap when that code is executed.**
>   There's a price for this flexibility: It can take more time to allocate and clean up heap storage than
>   stack storage (if you even could create objects on the stack in Java, as you can in C++). Over time,
>   however, Java's heap allocation mechanism has become very fast, so this is not an issue for
>   concern.
>
> - Constant storage<br>
>   **Constant values are often placed directly in the program code, which is safe since they can never
>   change.** Sometimes constants are cordoned off by themselves so they can be optionally placed in
>   read-only memory (ROM), in embedded systems.
>
> - Non-RAM storage<br>
>   **If data lives completely outside a program, it can exist while the program is not running, outside the
>   control of the program.** The two primary examples of this area serialized object, where objects are
>   turned into streams of bytes, generally send to another machine, and persistent objects, where the
>   objects are placed on disk so they will hold their state even when the program is terminated. The
>   trick with there types of storage is turning the objects into something that exist on the other medium,
>   and yet be resurrected into a regular RAM-based object when necessary. Java provides support for
>   lightweight persistence. Libraries such as JDBC and Hibernate provide more sophisticated support
>   for storing and retrieving object information using databases.

### class

> “class” is (approximately) synonymous with “type.” -- on java 8 page 38

### constructor

- This guarantees that the object is properly initialized you can get your hands on it.
- Priority order:
   1. specific super constructor
   2. superclass' constructor without parameters
   3. constructor by programmer in superclass
   4. constructor by default in superclass

![](http://www.hauchenglee.com/assets/images/tech/invoke_constructor_order.png)

### static

Static is a non-access modifier in Java. Any static member can be accessed before any objects of its class
 are created, and without reference to any object. It is applicable for the following:
1. blocks
2. variables
3. methods
4. nested classes

Static block:
- It can be used for static initializations of a class.
- It will executed exactly **only once** when the class is **first loaded**.
- Static block

```
class Demo {
    static int i;
    static {
        System.out.println("static 1");
    }
    Demo() {
        System.out.println("static constructor");
    }
    static {
        System.out.println("static 2, i = " + i);
    }
}

public class TestDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo con = new Demo();
        System.out.println("main method");
        System.out.println("Demo.i = " + Demo.i);
    }
}

// static 1
// static 2, i = 0
// static constructor
// main method
// Demo.i = 0
```

Static variables:
- It is **class-level** variable instead of local variable.
- All instances of the class share the same static variable.

Static methods:
- They can only directly call other static methods.
- They can only directly access static data.
- They cannot refer to **this** or **super** in any way.

Static nested classes:
- Java allows us to define a class within another class which is called a nested class.
The class which enclosed nested class is known as Outer class.
- In java, we can't make Top level class static. **Only nested classes can be static.**

### final

Final data:
- final primitive: final makes the value a constant
- final reference: Once the reference is initialized to an object, it can **never be changed** to point
 to another object. However, the object itself can be modified.

Blank finals:
- Blank finals are final fields without initialization values. The compiler ensures that blank finals are
 initialized before use.
- You're forced to perform assignments to finals either with an expression at the point of definition of the
 field or in every **constructor**. This guarantees that the final fields is always initialized before use.

Final arguments:
- Inside the method you can **read and return** the argument, but you **can't change** it.
- `i + 1;` ok
- `i++;` not allow
- `final object = new Object();` not allow

Final methods
- The first reason is to put a "lock" on the method to **prevent an inheriting class from changing that
 method meaning by overriding it**. This is done for design reasons when you want to make sure that a
 method's behavior is retained during inheritance.
- The second reason is that final were suggested in the past is efficiency.

Final classes
- When you say that an entire class is final (by preceding its definition with the final keyword), you're
 **preventing all inheritance** from this class.
- The fields of a final class can be final or not, as you choose. The same rules apply to final for fields
regardless of whether the class is defined as final. However, because it prevents inheritance, all methods
in final class are **implicitly final**, since there's no way to override them. **You can include the final
specifier to a method in a final class, but it doesn't add any meaning.**

### overload

Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature
can differ by the **number of** input parameters or **type of** input parameters or both.

We can overload:
- common method
- static method
- main() method

We cannot overload:
- methods on return type
- methods that differ only by static keyword

> -- [Overloading in Java - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overloading-in-java/)

### override

-  規則：
   - 父類別與子類別都必須要有同樣同名的方法
   - 若是沒有改寫，子類別會一字不改的延續使用父類別的方法
   - 若只有子類別有方法，父類別沒有同名方法，不能用父類別形態的物件去呼叫只存在子類別的方法
   - 當兩個方法形成重寫關係時，可以在子類中通過 **super** 關鍵字調用父類被重寫的方法
- 原因：
   - 通常是子類別具有其他特性，而且會先呼叫子類別的方法
   - 遵守 polymorphism 前提
- cannot be override:
   - private modifier
   - final methods
   - static methods

### pass by value

Java is always **pass-by-value**.

> When an argument is passed by value, a copy of the argument’s value is passed to the
> called method. The called method works exclusively with the copy. Changes to the called
> method’s copy **do not affect** the original variable’s value in the caller.

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog("Max");
    Dog oldDog = aDog;

    // we pass the object to foo
    foo(aDog);

    // aDog variable is still pointing to the "Max" dog when foo(...) returns
    aDog.getName().equals("Max"); // true
    aDog.getName().equals("Fifi"); // false
    aDog = oldDog; // true    
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals("Max"); // true

    // change d inside of foo() to point to a new Dog instance "Fifi"
    d = new Dog("Fifi");
    d.getName().equals("Fifi"); // true
}
```

In the example above `aDog.getName()` will return `"Max"`. The value `aDog` within `main` is not
changed in the function `foo` with the `Dog Fifi` as the object reference is passed by value. If it
were passed by reference, then the `aDog.getName()` in `main` would return `Fifi` after the call to
`foo`.

Likewise:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog aDog = new Dog("Max");
    Dog oldDog = aDog;

    foo(aDog);

    // when foo(...) returns, the name of the dog has been changed to "Fifi"
    aDog.getName().equals("Fifi"); // true

    // but it is still the same dog:
    aDog = oldDog; // true
}

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals("Max"); // true

    // this changes the name of d to be "Fifi"
    d.setName("Fifi");
}
```

In the above example, `Fifi` is the dog's name after call to `foo(aDog)` because the object's name was
set inside of `foo(...)`. Any operations that `foo` performs on `d` are such that, for all practical
purposes, they are performed on `aDog`, but it is **not** possible to change the value of the variable
`aDog` itself.
